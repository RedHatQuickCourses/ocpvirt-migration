= Add a VMware vSphere source provider and connect to VMware provider

== Prerequisites for the VMware Provider

The following prerequisites apply to all migrations:

* ISO/CD-ROM disks must be unmounted.
* Each NIC must contain one IPv4 and/or one IPv6 address.
* The VM operating system must be certified and supported for use as a link:https://access.redhat.com/articles/973163#ocpvirt[guest operating system with OpenShift Virtualization].
* VM names must contain only lowercase letters (a-z), numbers (0-9), or hyphens (-), up to a maximum of 253 characters. The first and last characters must be alphanumeric. The name must not contain uppercase letters, spaces, periods (.), or special characters.
* VM names must not duplicate the name of an existing VM in the OpenShift Virtualization environment.

The *Migration Toolkit for Virtualization* will automatically assign a new name to a VM that does not comply with the rules. If this happens, MTV will automatically generate a new VM name to allow the migration to proceed smoothly.

== Create the VMware provider to the migration toolkit

The *Migration Toolkit for Virtualization* (*MTV*) uses the VMware Virtual Disk Development Kit (*VDDK*) SDK to transfer virtual disks from VMware vSphere.

You must download the *VMware Virtual Disk Development Kit* (*VDDK*), build a VDDK image, and push the VDDK image to your image registry. You need the VDDK init image path in order to add a VMware source provider.

[IMPORTANT]
Storing the VDDK image in a public registry might violate the VMware license terms.

[NOTE]
If you want to configure in your lab then you can create ImageStreams and BuildConfigs.

=== Create namespace for migration

Create project called `vmexamples`.

=== Create ImageStreams and BuildConfigs

. Navigate to *Builds* -> *ImageStreams*
. Press *Create ImageStream*
+
image::MTV/38_Create_IS.png[]
. Replace the YAML content with the following code:
+
[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: image.openshift.io/v1
kind: ImageStream
metadata:
  name: vddk
  namespace: vmexamples
----

. Navigate to *Builds* -> *BuildConfigs*
. Press *Create BuildConfig* and select the *YAML view* radio button at the top.
+

. Replace the YAML content with the following code
+
[source, yaml,%nowrap]
----
kind: BuildConfig
apiVersion: build.openshift.io/v1
metadata:
  name: vddk-build
  namespace: vmexamples
spec:
  output:
    to:
      kind: ImageStreamTag
      name: 'vddk:latest'
  strategy:
    type: Docker
    dockerStrategy:
      from:
        kind: ImageStreamTag
        namespace: openshift
        name: 'tools:latest'
  source:
    type: Dockerfile
    dockerfile: |
      FROM registry.access.redhat.com/ubi8/ubi-minimal
      RUN curl -L -O www.opentlc.com/download/ocp4_baremetal/VMware-vix-disklib-7.0.3-20134304.x86_64.tar.gz
      RUN tar -xzf VMware-vix-disklib-7.0.3-20134304.x86_64.tar.gz
      RUN mkdir -p /opt
      ENTRYPOINT ["cp", "-r", "/vmware-vix-disklib-distrib", "/opt"]
  triggers:
    - type: ImageChange
      imageChange: {}
    - type: ConfigChange
----

. Navigate to *Builds* -> *Builds* and wait until the build status is *Complete*.

=== Add VMWare Provider

[NOTE]
In this demo lab, VMware provider is already added.
If you are performing this on your own setup then you can follow the below instructions to add VMware provider.

. Navigate in the left menu to *Migration* -> *Providers for virtualization*

. Select project `openshift-mtv`

. By default, there is a provider called `host` which represents the *OpenShift Virtualization* as a target platform
+
image::MTV/92_MTV_Provider_list.png[]
+
However, you will need to register the source vCenter system to the Migration Toolkit for Virtualization as a new provider.

. Press *Create Provider* button in the top right. A dialog box will appear.
+

+
// WKTBD: replace with student's credentials
. Select *VMware* on the *Provider type* dropdown and fill the following data:
.. *Name*: `vmware`
.. *vCenter host name or IP address*: `portal.vc.opentlc.com`
.. *vCenter user name*: `vcenter_user`
.. *vCenter password*: `vcenter_password`
.. *VDDK init image*: `image-registry.openshift-image-registry.svc:5000/openshift/vddk:latest`
.. *SHA-1 fingerprint*: `C7:BF:C2:DD:CD:73:1C:22:DC:D1:5A:DD:EA:64:21:C1:97:FB:F0:9C`
+
image::MTV/94_MTV_Fill_Dialog.png[]
.  Press *Create* and wait till the *Status* column is changed to `Ready`
+

Now MTV knows about your VMware vSphere environment and can connect to it.
