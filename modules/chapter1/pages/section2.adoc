= Install Migration Toolkit Virtualization Operator

== Migration Toolkit for Virtualization

Refer https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/migration_toolkit_for_virtualization/2.6[Migration Toolkit for Virtualization] (MTV) to import a virtual machine from VMware vSphere to OpenShift. The migration toolkit supports two "modes" of import:

* _Cold migration_ turns off the source virtual machine before starting the migration. This is the default migration type.
* _Warm migration_ copies data while the source virtual machine continues to run. Once the bulk of data has been migrated, the VM is shutdown and the final data is copied to the destination. The new VM can then be started, resulting in a much shorter period of downtime for the VM-hosted application.

The migration toolkit has already been deployed to your cluster using the Operator. Documentation for how to install and configure the Operator can be found https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/migration_toolkit_for_virtualization/2.6/html/installing_and_using_the_migration_toolkit_for_virtualization/installing-the-operator_mtv[here].

If you would like to learn more about how to configure the Migration Toolkit for Virtualization, please see https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/migration_toolkit_for_virtualization/2.6/html/installing_and_using_the_migration_toolkit_for_virtualization/prerequisites_mtv#vmware-prerequisites_mtv[here] for VMware vSphere.
