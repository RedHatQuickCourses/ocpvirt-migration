= Install OpenShift Virtualization Operator

== Review Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform Cluster

=== Verify Requirements

Before you install OpenShift Virtualization for Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform 4, make sure that your Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform cluster meets the following requirements:

* Your cluster must be installed on bare-metal infrastructure with Red Hat Enterprise Linux^(R)^ CoreOS (RHCOS) workers.
+
OpenShift Virtualization supports only RHCOS worker nodes--Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL 7 and RHEL 8) nodes are _not_ supported. 
// Should this be added under 'note' section?
* Additionally, your cluster must use the installer-provisioned infrastructure and deploy machine health checks to maintain high availability (HA) of virtual machines.
* You must manage your compute nodes according to the number and size of the virtual machines that you want to host in the cluster.

=== Review Nodes and Machines

. Log in to the OpenShift Container Platform web console using the administrator credentials provided in the previous lab, if you are not already logged in.
. From the navigation menu, select *Compute* -> *Nodes*:

+
There are three master and three workers in the OpenShift 4 Cluster. Additionally, the `ipmi` (Intelligent Platform Management Interface) is being used to manage the bare-metal nodes.

. Click a worker node to obtain resource information about the node, and navigate to the *Details* tab to review the information about the operating system:

+
The bare-metal node is configured using RHCOS.

. Select *Compute* -> *Bare Metal Hosts*:

+
[NOTE]
Ignore the "Registration error" message if it appears.

. Click a worker node to obtain information about the physical (bare-metal) node:

[NOTE]
Ignore the "Registration error" message if it appears.

== Install Operator

In this section, you learn to install an Operator from the *OperatorHub* page. You manage Operators from the Administrator perspective in the web console.

[NOTE]
In the demo lab, OpenShift Virtualization Operator is already installed.
If you are performing this on your own setup then you can follow the below instructions to install the Operator.

. From the navigation menu, select *Operators* -> *OperatorHub*:
+
image::Install/01_OperatorHub_Menu.png[]

. Explore the *OperatorHub* page and note that all of the currently available Operators are displayed:
+
image::Install/02_OperatorHub_Dashboard.png[]
+
The dashboard lists the Operators that can be installed and various ways to filter the list.

. In the *Filter by keyword...* field, type `OpenShift Virtualization` and select the OpenShift Virtualization tile:
+
image::Install/03_OperatorHub_Search.png[]
+
You can also filter by category, installation state, provider, provider type, capability level, or infrastructure features.

. Click *Install*:
+
image::Install/04_OperatorHub_Install.png[]

. On the *Install Operator* wizard page that opens with the default options selected, click  *Install*:
+
image::Install/05_OperatorHub_Install_Wizard.png[]
+
The wizard allows you to specify the update channel, the installation mode, the installed Namespace, and the update approval strategy options.
+
As the installation progresses, the status is shown.

. When the installation is complete, click *Create HyperConverged* to create the required custom resource:
+
image::Install/06_OperatorHub_Install_Progress.png[]

. Review the *Create HyperConverged* wizard options:
+
image::Install/08_Create_HyperConverged.png[]

. Without changing the default values, scroll down and click *Create* to open the *OpenShift Virtualization Deployment* tab for the OpenShift Virtualization Operator:
+
image::Install/09_Hyperconverged_Tab.png[]

. Watch the *Status* column until the status changes to `Available`:
+
image::Install/10_Hyperconverged_Available.png[]

== Examine OpenShift Virtualization Operator

. Click the *Details* tab to view information about the Operator:
+
image::Install/11_Details_1.png[]

. Scroll down to the *ClusterServiceVersion details* section and review the details:
+
image::Install/11_Details_2.png[]
+
You can see the Namespace where the Operator was installed, the status, the different Operator deployments created during the installation, the Operator ServiceAccounts created, and the OperatorGroup.

. Scroll up and click the *Subscription* tab to view the subscription details:
+
image::Install/12_Subscription.png[]
+
[NOTE]
Subscribing an Operator to one or more namespaces makes the Operator available to developers on your cluster.

== Examine PersistentVolumeClaims Created by Operator

During the installation of the Operator, some PersistentVolumeClaims for different distributions are created:

* Red Hat Enterprise Linux 8.0+
* Red Hat Enterprise Linux 9.0
* Fedora 34+
* CentOS Stream 8
* CentOS Stream 9

In this section, you examine the PVCs created by the Operator.

. In the left menu, navigate to *Storage* and click *PersistentVolumeClaims*:
+
image::Install/13_PVCs.png[]

. Explore the *PersistentVolumeClaims* page and the information provided about the PVCs.
